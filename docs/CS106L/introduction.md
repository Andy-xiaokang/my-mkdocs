# Introduction

## why don't we code in assembly

* it's too difficult to code and understand
* it's not portable because the assembly code is specific to specific computer operating system

## C++ History: invention of C

Idea:

* source code can be written in a more intuitive language
* An additional program can convert it into assembly

C was popular since it was simple. this was also its weakness:

* No ***objects*** or ***classes***
* difficult to write code that worked ***generically***
* Tedious when writing **large** programs

Design Philosophy of C++

* allow the programmer full control, responsibility, and choice if they want it.
* express ideas and intent directly in code
* enforce safety at compile time whenever possible
* do not waste time or space
* compartmentalize messy constructs
