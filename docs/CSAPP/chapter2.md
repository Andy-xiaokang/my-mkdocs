# Representing and Manipulating Information

### 2.1.3 addressing and Byte Ordering

For program objects that span multiple bytes, we must establish two conventions: what the address of the object will be, and how we will order the bytes in memory.  

* In virtually all machines, a multi-byte object is stored as a contiguous sequence of bytes, **with the address of the object given by the smallest address of the bytes used.**
* for ordering the bytes representing an object, there are two common conventions.
