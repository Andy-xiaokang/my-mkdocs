# Metaprogramming
[programs that operate on programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming) Metaprogramming is a programming technique in which computer programs have the ability to treat other programs as their data. It means that a program can be designed to read, generate, analyze or transform other programs, and even modify itself while running.
